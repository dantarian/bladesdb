Feature: Recycle character
  As a player
  I want to recycle a character for monster points
  If I've played them a couple of games and not enjoyed the character

  Background:
    Given there is a user
    And the user has a character
    And the user is logged in

  Scenario Outline: Character can be recycled
    Given the character has played <games> games, earning 10 character points per game
    And the character has <points> character points before the games
    When the user recycles the character
    Then the character should be recycled
    And the user should have a pending monster point adjustment for <mp_refund> monster points

    Examples:
      | games | points | mp_refund |
      | 0     | 21     | 1         |
      | 1     | 40     | 30        |
      | 2     | 100    | 100       |
      | 3     | 170    | 180       |

    Given the character has <start_cp> character points
    And the character has bought <cp_bought> character points for <mp_spent> monster points

    Then the user should have a pending monster point adjustment for <mp_refund> monster points
